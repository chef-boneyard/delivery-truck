      # is inherently flawed. You can rename a cookbook in the metadata.rb and
      # leave it in the same path. You can move a cookbook to a new path and
      # could have edited it after the move. The cookbook might not exist in
      # this repo at the merge base - imagine migrating cookbooks from one repo
      # to another. It would next to impossible for delivery to correctly guess
      # the correct "base" version of this cookbook. We simply assume that if
      # a base cookbook were to exist, it exists at the same location with the
